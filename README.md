# SkillCraft Technology - Data Science Internship: Task 1

This repository contains the work for the first task of the SkillCraft Technology Data Science Internship.

## 📝 Project Description

The goal of this task was to perform a simple data visualization of categorical and continuous variables on a dataset. 
I created two bar charts to visualize population trends and distributions using Python with the Matplotlib.

## 📊 Visualizations

Here are the charts generated from the analysis:

**1. India's Population Increase (1960-2024)**
